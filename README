All code that I post to this repository is made by me and is free for anyone to use and modify for any purpose, with no restrictions. I would appreciate it if you left the attribution in the comment, but even this isn't necessary.

If you have any questions about my code, you can contact me at http://www.kongregate.com/accounts/player_03. You may also be able to reach me on GitHub, but I can't guarantee a quick response in that case.
